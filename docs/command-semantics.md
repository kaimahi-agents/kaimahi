# Command alignment

Tracking issue: [#301](https://github.com/kaimahi-agents/kaimahi/issues/301).
The [CLI reference](kmx.md) documents the implemented interface. This page
distinguishes the first implementation slice from proposed follow-ups.

## Implemented entry-point alignment (unreleased)

| Canonical command | Compatibility input | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `kmx context show` | `kmx ctx` | Read the effective context, selection source and posture. |
| `kmx context use <context>` | `kmx ctx <context>` | Remember KMX's access selection after the existing context guard; never change kubectl current-context. |
| `kmx local up` | `kmx up` | Provision the local kind environment, model and Orka; no agent. The existing `--step` choices remain. |
| `kmx local down` | `kmx down` | Delete the named local kind cluster, including its data, under the existing context/container-engine guard. |

Bare `context` and `local` display help. Canonical commands use the existing
operations, settings, saved-selection file and guards. Old spellings remain
callable and emit deprecation notices only on stderr; help and completion lead
with the canonical names. No removal release has been scheduled. Tagged v0.4.1
uses the compatibility spellings; the canonical names require a newer build.

The redirected context report retains its `source: kmx ctx` provenance label
for saved selections as a compatibility format. That label is not a next-step
command. Generated selection and local teardown instructions use the canonical
spellings. Invocation-specific confirmation may repeat the compatibility
command the caller actually supplied to preserve its exact arguments.

Generated local commands preserve `KIND_CLUSTER`, `CONTAINER_ENGINE` and
`--context`. AKS retry/teardown instructions use the common effective-option
renderer, including `--byo` only for the existing ownership mode; Azure setup
and cleanup diagnostics say AKS rather than agent Lift. The carried scripts
use these native instructions when invoked by KMX. Standalone script use has
no KMX ownership receipt, so its fallback names the actual script with quoted
arguments instead of a deleted Make target or an invented BYO recovery route.

## Vocabulary

**Decided: keep Create → Prove → Lift.** Lift is the chosen lifecycle verb for
the local-to-remote journey: create an agent locally, prove it with a real
answer, then lift it to a remote environment. Retain `kmx agent lift` and
interactive `/lift`; use **Lift** consistently in help, menu labels and the
product narrative. Do not rename the agent command to `deploy`. “Deployment”
remains useful technical language for the resulting resources and receipts.

The current bare `kmx lift` spelling is the deprecated AKS provisioning route,
not a shorthand for `kmx agent lift`. This vocabulary decision does not change
that route's arguments or behavior; any reassignment needs an explicit
compatibility transition coordinated with #223.

- **Context:** a kubeconfig access selection; not a durable cluster identity.
- **Target:** selected runtime, cluster identity, namespace and deployment
  destination, following [#238](https://github.com/kaimahi-agents/kaimahi/issues/238).
- **Runtime adapter:** KMX's integration with an execution platform.
- **Inference provider/backend:** an independent model-access route.
- **Provision** infrastructure; **install** runtime software; **create** an
  agent; **run/chat**; **evaluate** a revision; **lift** a bundle to a prepared
  destination; **show** live details; report deployment **status**; **retire**
  bundle-owned resources.
- **Ready**, **answered** and **evaluated** identify different evidence.
  **Unknown** is not **absent**. **Retry** resubmits; **result** retrieves the
  existing execution.

Bundle lift does not transfer sessions, memory or live state, delete its source,
or perform cutover. Workload retirement is separate from infrastructure teardown.
The guided live-copy fallback is explicitly untracked, not a bundle deployment.

## Audit and existing work

The original source/help audit at `9ebc27b` found 37 visible executable leaves,
two deprecated AKS spellings, three retirement stubs, 12 advertised chat
controls (plus `/quit`), and seven console slash controls plus menu/key actions.
Upstream `a3d809b` adds `suite validate`; current main hides the two AKS leaves
from root discovery while preserving direct invocation. This slice adds one
executable leaf by splitting context show/use, for 37 root-discoverable leaves,
and retains old entry points as compatibility routes. Cobra help/internal
completion are excluded.

Sources: command constructors and completion in [`cmd/kmx`](../cmd/kmx), chat
registry/dispatch in [`chat_slash.go`](../internal/kmx/app/chat_slash.go) and
[`runtime_session.go`](../internal/kmx/app/runtime_session.go), console actions
in [`agent_tui.go`](../internal/kmx/app/agent_tui.go), current guides, Make and
embedded script recovery messages. This is a source/help audit, not a new
live-cluster proof.

The review identified mixed singular/plural groups, noun-only mutations,
inconsistent inspection verbs, `local` meaning cluster-configured inference,
different prompt/file flags, different bundle/live target flags, and preview
modes with different file/network/cluster effects. It also found stale status
formats, namespace claims, governance wording and deleted Make recovery targets.
These are tracked in #301 rather than silently treated as part of this slice.

Merged [#203](https://github.com/kaimahi-agents/kaimahi/pull/203) is the precedent
for separating AKS provisioning from agent lift. #301 owns command consistency
and compatibility over these operations, not parallel implementations.

## Proposed follow-ups — not current syntax

| Existing command | Proposed alignment |
|---|---|
| `quickstart-wizard` | `quickstart --interactive`, with mode-specific flag validation; bare quickstart remains deterministic. |
| `agent chat --interactive <name>` | Intrinsically interactive `agent chat <name>`, preserving initial-message compatibility. |
| `plane` | `plane deploy`; preserve bare invocation during transition. |
| `migrate` | `plane migrate` |
| `models add` | `plane upstream add` |
| `models credential copilot` | `plane upstream login copilot` |
| `credentials`, `credential issue/renew` | `plane credential list/issue/renew` |
| `budget` | Explicit `plane budget set/clear <credential>`; old bare budget clears caps and needs a compatibility wrapper. |
| `ledger`, `flow`, `watch` | `plane ledger show`, `plane activity list/watch` |
| `backup`, `restore`, `metrics` | `plane backup/restore/metrics` |

Interactive controls should share resource/action names: `/agent show`,
`/agent chat`, `/agent use`, `/agent tools configure`,
`/agent inference configure`, and console `/context use local|remote <context>`.
Preserve `/lift` and Lift labels for the local-to-remote journey; any future
grouped `/agent lift` spelling must preserve that entry point.
Use `/inference use cluster|host-copilot|host-foundry` to distinguish execution
routes, `/exit` with `/quit` compatibility, and `/verbose on|off` coordinated
with #292. Retain keyboard shortcuts and advertise only supported controls.

Proposed flag alignment: `--prompt`/`--prompt-file` instead of `--task`,
`--instructions-file` instead of file-valued `--instructions`, `--bundle-dir`
and `--bundles-dir`, and `--output jsonl` for activity watch. Keep report
`--output` separate from artifact `--out`; preserve raw and answer-only stdout.

## Remaining decisions

1. **Infrastructure hierarchy:** #223 owns the long-term Azure interface;
   `target aks` is not the chosen final shape. `aks up/down` remain callable
   compatibility routes, hidden from root help and completion.
2. **Runtime setup:** retain `orka install/status` pending agreement on a
   generic runtime setup family; a name cannot imply installer support.
3. **Capability view:** #289 explicitly asks to reconcile `capabilities` with
   `targets`; choose one operation/name with that issue.
4. **Authoring/execution verbs:** reconcile applying `create` with offline
   `new`, `evaluate` with `test`, and `agent run` with canvas-service `run start`
   through #276 and its authoring/execution work. Their scopes differ.
5. **Runtime selection:** settle operator/saved configuration versus public
   selection through #224/#238; retain current capabilities in rename slices.
6. **Target flags:** decide `--to-*` versus `--context/--namespace` with bundle
   defaults, multi-target status, namespace ambiguity and alias conflicts.
7. **Preview terms:** distinguish artifact rendering, no-write planning and
   server validation, including downloads/cache/local files and which resources
   admission actually checks. Do not mechanically alias `--no-apply` modes.
8. **Removal timing:** announce a breaking minor release before removing
   compatibility routes. No date/version is selected by this slice.

## Keeping future work aligned

[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) records the contributor rules. For each implemented
slice, update command registration, help, completion, interactive labels where
applicable, generated next/recovery commands, primary docs, compatibility tests
and CHANGELOG together. Use existing operation handlers. Keep historical records
and deliberate compatibility fixtures distinct from current examples.

Tests must cover more than names: read-only behavior, saved selection and refusal,
context/namespace/engine preservation, mode conflicts before operation loading,
stdout versus stderr, and operation result/exit compatibility. Help/completion
must not perform operational mutations. Doc-link/map and boundary checks should
include newly added files.
